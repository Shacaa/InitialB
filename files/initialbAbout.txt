InitialB is a Discord bot developed by Shaca(#0982).
I'm the one hosting InitialB (not a server) so it won't be online 24/7 sadly.

**Schedules:**
Mon-Fri: 11 to 24hrs GMT
Sat-Sun: ???

**Latest update - v2.0.1 (11/08/18):**
- Now you can get songs submitted by a specific user using "+-musicshare @username".
- Using this command also tells you the amount of songs submitted by them.

**Previous big update - v2.0.0 (24/07/18):**
- Big infrastructure changes and improvements.
- Code has been modulated, what does it mean?
.	 - Improvements to commands/events handler.
.    - No need to reset bot for applying updates/fixes.
.    - In case of a crash/bug while running a command the bot won't die.
- Small improvements to musicshare.
- Now when joining a server InitialB asks for a few (NON intrusive) permissions.
- Fixed bug where if not sub was given to reddit command it would post something from bot's frontpage (now posts from r/all).
- And some people say sequels are bad pff.
